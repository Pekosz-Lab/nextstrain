We thank the Mostafa Lab for coordinating and processing nasal swab samples for whole genome sequencing. Data are available via GISAID from The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

If using these data for publication or reporting, please cite the Mostafa Lab where possible and reach out if unsure.

Tanglegrams can be generated within each build using the format:
https://nextstrain.org/groups/PekoszLab-Public/{subtype}/{segment}:groups/PekoszLab-Public/{subtype}/{segment}

Example (h1:na):

Special thanks to Amary Fall, David Villafuerte, Madeline Yunker, and Omar Abdullah for their expertise in generating and sharing these sequences.
