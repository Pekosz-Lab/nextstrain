We gratefully awknowledge the [Mostafa Lab](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/Heba+Mabrouk+Mostafa/2777563) for their hard work coordinating and processing nasal swab samples for whole genome sequencing. Please note that the data here are availible through [GISAID](https://gisaid.org/) submitted from The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

If these data are used for publication or reporting, the Mostafa lab should be cited where possible, Please reach out if uncertain. 

Currently, tanglegrams can be consutrcted within each build using the following format:
