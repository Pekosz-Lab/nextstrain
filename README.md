# Pekosz Lab Nextstrain Builds

This repository houses all configuration data and **WORKING** scripts for the [Pekosz Lab nextstrain builds](https://nextstrain.org/groups/PekoszLab) as well as their required Nextclade datasets. Currently, 2 types of datasets are regularly maintained: 

1. 24 [Seasonal Influenza Genome Builds](seasonal-flu/) (H1N1, H3N2, and B/Vic) of circulaing viruses detected through the Johns Hopkins Hospital Network supported by [JH-CEIRR](https://www.ceirr-network.org/centers/jh-ceirr).

2. Specialized Builds Unique to Pekosz Lab-specific manuscripts.

> [!IMPORTANT] ðŸš§
> This repository is under construction thus scripts are not constructed for optimal run efficiency.
